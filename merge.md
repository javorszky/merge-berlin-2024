# merge

Hell yeah merge conf berlin 13-14 june 2024.

## day 0

met with @techknowlogick (cofounder of gitea), chatted about gitea, startups, oss stuff, pricing, ads, investment

## day 1

venue is fantastic, teptrow arena berlin, wifi is fast, talks are about to kick off

### talk 0: intro

incredibly well done production, the sound is loud, crisp, but not overwhelming

### talk 1: why github was a success by tom preston-werner (@mojombo), co founder of github

giveaway of an apple vr thingy. we get to win it. github: 100mil+ devs and 1bil+ revenue. also created semver, also created toml. created toml while a little drunk one night. he invested in 145 companies since 2012, so he knows what goes, what doesn't.

Building dev tools is the conf for. Most important thing to have as a startup. (I think it's usecase / users). It's **product market fit**. Product market fit is actually just sparkling **a real problem you have figured out hot to solve**.

actual marketing page: "git repository hosting no longer a pain in the ass" (sic!). have a git repository and want to share it online? We do that! (controversy around swearing on home page :D)

if you can't explain your product in a few words, figure it out.

Also start small, then fuel over time. Github started in user groups, meetups, and go from there. icanhazruby. github is better than svn, lemme show how it works! -> conversations with the right people -> ruby on rails moved to github.

Find the niche to start with, serve that niche, then grow it.

Then meetups -> "drinkups". They went to bars (in SF), and then paid for folks' drinks -> lots of goodwill, and did it around the world to build up the userbase.

Met yahoo folks at a drinkup, and then they had an in to yahoo -> gave a talk at yahoo about github. Growing base of interested users.

But building a startup that doesn't have a product market fit? sisyphian effort.

#### Product market fit

**THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD BE DOING IN YOUR STARTUP IF YOU DON'T HAVE PRODUCT MARKET FIT IS TO FIND A PRODUCT MARKET FIT**

Idea about "virality". Decision around user / project to be first. User first, project second was the decision, and it was also super very important. Putting user first reduces barrier to entry (put up whatever project under your userspace whether it's useful or not).

"Fork you" shirt, back was `github.com/______` blank to be filled in by t-shirt wearer

Github would pay employees to go speak at confs to plant seeds because they'd share their github urls.

#### Bootstrapping

You need to make money with the thing in order to keep doing it. Gravatar is anti-example: lots of cost, no income.

Github started as a side project, needed a business model. GH business model: free for open source, pay for privacy.

Focus on the customer. If all of your money comes from them, take care of them.

Thrift makes you creative (need to save money). -> [How we made github fast](https://github.blog/2009-10-20-how-we-made-github-fast/) (october 20, 2009)

No need for a big fancy office.

Profitability is peace of mind, fundraising bandwagon is stress++.

Only hired people when they had the money to do so. Need to be efficient, because bootstrapping.

If you do have profitability, it gives you an insane amount of leverage against VCs. $100 mil first raise, they didn't _need_ to do that, therefore the VCs really wanna give you money. Write own term sheet, VCs can fill in the numbers.

#### Superfans

How to create GitHub superfans. How to surprise / delight / be weird / crazy about stuff. GitHub built a life sized oval office replica in a github office.

"I'm (gh customer) waiting for a meeting with X (GitHub) in their Oval fucking office!!!"

customer story: customer was angry, displeased about something. One of the employees started badmouthing the customer, that was shut down really quick. Something is wrong, then your product is not good enough. Let's solve it, customer emailed: "I'm sorry I was an asshole" -> sometimes becomes superfan.

#### Branding

Inspired by songbird. They had a character, a bird, doing things: farting always while doing things. Or the fail whale (twitter). So they went to images, to stock photo, and bought the original octocat for $5, octo puss. Super pixely, like 120x78? :D

Then started putting it on to stuff, decorating the octo cat. They hired full time artists to draw octo cats, then stickers, shirts, scotch glasses, etc.

YouTube: digital ocean video on DO's account, but they have an octo cat sticker on the animated laptop :D. Tattoos of octo cats.

#### Values

It's not about branding, or github-the-corporation. They do it because getting a tat, or a sticker or whatever is a secret handshake, a declaration of values, a belonging, some commonality. If you (the audience) wear a github t-shirt, have a github sticker, why do you do this? What does it mean for people / users to identify with your brand? Octo cat - I know you, you're into open source, you're into development, you're into the same things that I am.

"Care only about what your users think of themselves as a result of interacting with your creation." - Kathy Sierra

Metrics - measure the things your users care about. Or "give users a way to kick ass." - Kathy Sierra -> virality

#### Dogfooding

(when I find out there's 60g of protein in dog food - kylo: I know what must be done but I don't know if I have the strength to do it)

Dogfooding isn't a thing outside of tech apparently. Apparently started by a pet food company where an exec in a board meeting actually ate their dog food to demonstrate how good that is.

Using github to build github. All employees had to _pay_ for github, because if they didn't they'd miss the "paying for the github" experience (they would be reimbursed). You want to know if there's an issue with the billing system.

Culture of shipping. Shipit squirrel is also a Scott (MC) story. Shipping code to users is the goal, software is never done, never perfect, but it can be shipped, and it can get into the hands of users to create value.

6 mo to ship first publicly available version of github.

#### Internal tools

Build your own things! (some of those ended up being billion $$$ startups independently from them)

#### Beware the hype train

Powerset - natural language search engine. Ship things, and underperform, and lost the goodwill of the community.

Magic Leap - lots of money, lots of hype, but super undeerwhelming. They could never achieve what their marketing said.

vs oculus: they had crappy slow versions, then iterated, they told users that these are dev versions, therefore not expect much. 

Only company that can ship perfect stuff immediately is apple, because infinite money. "We invented a thing that changes the world forever, and you can buy it today!!" - hyped it for like 30 seconds.

Vision Pro is weird, because they need to talk about things (maybe FCC req?) - but is it hyped?

**REPUTATION ISN'T BUILT ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO, IT'S BUILT ON WHAT YOU DO**

#### Optimizing for happiness

What's the point (of building the company)? Invest in people, and let them be great. Flat hierarchy, distributed, not a lot of managers.

Book reco: Daniel H. Pink - Drive

People -> Process -> Product

#### Q&A

##### How did the idea of github even start?

At powerset - git is amazing, and then we can sync it with subversion! Poll from user accounts on linux, etc. Git was awesome, but it was super inaccessible to anyone, because it was very much locked away, set up linux user account for your people, etcetcetc.

But I'm a web developer, and I know other web devs, so we can solve this, and abstract away the pain.

##### Are you (tom werner-preston) still writing code?

Side projects, little box, dial, nfc card, url of a music album, device is bound to sonos speaker, so microcontroller code for that, occasionally, but for the project that he's involved in, he's a designer.

### talk 2: Fireside chat with david cramer: david vs GNUliath

About open source, running an open source company.

#### Where did it all begin?

Just build stuff, internet is accessible, you just build somehting, put it out there, source forge, google code, github, etc. Open source was more of a community thing, so OSS just made sense.

#### Where does the passion come from?

Sentry is ~400 people, so he finds new things about it and argue with people about it on twitter/x. Cares less about the _ideals_ and more about access to tech, access to software, what the internet is /was: big open platform. Access should remain a thing for folks. He kept open sourcing things, and people just let him.

Sentry took some loud and controversial opinions about open source. It's just a distribution model for businesses, but also access as well.

#### Started as django-db-log, how, where?

Django community, contribute a lot to django events. Solved a particular issue for a particular thing.

linux evangelism is weird, doesn't care about it.

This is not interesting...

#### How did you know that django-db-log would take off?

Built stuff that solved a problem. Worked at disqus (comments) at the time. Positive feedback loop, disqus used OSS libraries he's written, and he wanted to bootstrap a co around it. Customers from day 1 because they hosted it for others.

#### ??? don't remember the question

Copied the pricing of the one competitor, so they wanted to make it affordable, and then they iterated around it a lot. Goal: to be THE default for the thing they're doing. If you're an enterprise only tool, you can't be the default. If you charge a lot, you can't be the default.

Pricing now: the more errors you have, the more money you pay.

#### Business models around open source

Right now we're at another inflexion point in open source: different value sets exist. The open source foundation is essentially a religion. Commercially protected open source, or fair-source.

Open source is a distribution model, not a business model. If it's a distribution model, you need to fund it. How do you have some degree of protection?

The way sentry survives is the funding from the company. There's no charity. There's the risk of other companies taking your thing, and running you with it.

Functional-source licence: we build the IP, you can host it, but can't compete with it. In 2 years it becomes permissive.

Sentry's approach to commercialising open source will not work for everyone. Sentry: cares about open source, but rubber meets road, so others can't be selling their thing.

#### capitalism

[healthy dose of capitalism](https://cra.mr/open-source-and-a-healthy-dose-of-capitalism) - there's an opportunity to make money. We're not the starving artists, we're the tech industry. Ethically conscious way of earning money: give back (code, money).

If you contribute to sentry, there'll be an email: "we'll pay you for your work you do because it brings us value." It's always win-win. $500k given away for OSS developers. That's less than one month for adsense. Have to have the ROI for it.

Licensing, funding model, distribution are all important decisions.

#### what are the lines don't wanna cross

Failure: hashicorp - they are not driven by first party, they rely on third parties to push them forward, selfish to change licence.  They're protecting the IP.

Very large corps: take open source things, repackage, and sell it. The builders should still be rewarded. Lot of technology relies on charity.

Prometheus is an example: a LOT of companies rely on it for a lot of their revenue, but do they reward it back? No.

(I kinda see NGINX here as one of this)

#### How did you end up with functional source licence

Legal / illegal things? The only protection is just trademarks, which is very weak.

There was a company that tried to ship sentry as part of their stack, but not pay sentry for this. Switched business-source licence: for up to 4 years under the proprietary licence, after 4 years it can turn into whatever.

Sentry wasn't happy with BSL. FSL is no variability, fixed: you cannot commercialise it for 2 years, and then it's apache.

Copyleft, but that has chilling effect (forces ideals on users), or open-core, which is part closed-source, and usually closed-source is what you want.

The 2 years - forces to innovate.

FSL can be learned, and not need individual legal review again and again.

#### what was the response to FSL?

been good. fundamentalists are bad, because the practicality dies. they are loud - folks just want free software. Third party ecosystems thrive because of this.

library: you should have access to books, use it, but shouldn't reprint books and sell them.

#### fair-source licence?

Launches soon, try to fix the open source footgun. ROI is marketing.

#### question

open source is a tip jar: reward people with money that do work for you. Sustainability is important: to give work away for free: rewarded, and not exploited.

#### is AI fixing problems?

protip: do not use AI because it doesn't produce code, it gives you snippets -> leads to blackouts. Gimmicky AI, like everyone

#### LLMs on thinking about open source

Use LLMs to use semantic matching. Fingerprinting erros, grouping the same kind together, etc, LLMs are good about this one. They are not _safe_, so you need to train the models on what you wanna do, but using them exposes the risk of exposing the training data. None of us want the business data exposed. Privacy is very very very important.

Open source is wild west, a lot of things are called open source that aren't.


### talk 3: embracing the pivot: an engineering perspective on adaptability by cassidy williams

talk was a surprise, not the ross-meme (PIVOT!!), change is inevitable, so startup journey

Previously: CTO of contentda, right now it's just dev advocate.

Startup started with stickers: physically mailing stickers to people. Mailing the most number of streams on twitch to scale stickers to everyone on the streams.

Pivot: stream subscribers, how to retain them on the platform? Working, but ... what to do with the data?

Creator resurfacing content: you tweeted this a year ago, wanna recreate it?

Creator recreating content: video -> blog post, or video -> tweet thread, AI thing

Technical creators reusing content -> take a tech blog post, and turn it into a tweet thread, or take a tech talk -> tutorial

Then tech industry did a chaos

Took the API for transforming media, to prompted text:
    * high schoolers writing college essays -> talk at bot, suggest stuff back but not solve the things

Turned into "Brain story", and it would help you flesh out the thing, but it's now open source, you can use it, but it's been spun down.

When pivoting: which part can I salvage, which part do I throw away? Is this future proof, or completely rewrite as if it's temporary?

#### Mindset shift

Love what we build! I created it, I AM A GOD! But the code is just a thing we made, your work is not permanent. This is a good thing, do NOT be attached to things, because spiral of "I WILL MAKE THIS WORK", which leads to sunk cost fallacy, so we keep doing it even though we should stop and ... pivot?

"The most dangerous phrase in the language is: we've always done it this way." - Grace Hopper

If it ain't broken, don't fix it, but sometimes it's broken under the surface and it does need changing.

Pivoting is common: 1 in 3 startups does it.

https://cass.run/pivots

Leny's Newsletter (TK - look it up)

#### You should be building flexible systems

* actual code components
* data you have
* parts of an idea
* processes

Pivots:

stickers: we pulled the details to send out stickers, so what if we could use some other part of the data we already got to resurfacing

"I don't wanna resurface content, but it would be cool if I could use it to create new content!" - customer feedback

Take what we have, refine to technical -> recreate, then gpt4 came out

then underlying API can be used for other things

take bits, pieces, feedback, parts to make it work for the next phase.

They got really good at mindset shift. Yes, we wanna say "yes we are 100% in in this idea" - to investors, but we also need to be ready to shift mindsets because nothing is permanent. Get to "good enough", see if it works, if it doesn't, don't spend time perfecting the good enough further.

Ask a lot of **scary questions**:

* has our growth stalled? Is it just not good enough for our users?
* Is retention low? "Well, that's neat, good for you, bye"
* is interest lukewarm? folks tried because they liked them as people
* is it just not good enough?

"seven months in, we only made $600" - shahed Khan, co-founder Loom

"The whole thing didn't make any sense" - Steve Chen, co-founder YouTube, used to be a dating platform

"why is everything AI, I am so tired" - Cassidy Williams, now

This can be also about own projects:

* are systems or processes working? Is the issue tracking working? Is this process of retros working? Should we change it?
* is your codebase ... good? Sometimes it's just... bad. Net promoter score: is the code good? -100 from all engineers. If the engineers don't wanna work on it, they're not gonna.
* if you continue building this way, will your team be successful? - copying api endpoints to make shit work.

fill this out:


        |  like    | don't like
good at | prioritize | optimize, don't do too much, automate
not good at | learning | delegate, burnout happens here

learning: don't ship stuff here

#### Pivots are scary

Process, but also the thing. It's about the journey. (cliche) If you focus on the exit, or 100 mil users, then it's easy to get discouraged when you hit setbacks. Learn through iterations. If you focus on the end, you're not focusing / enjoying the journey.

#### Pivots have made her better

Better ideas, better planning, better teammate, better founder. "Have to say no again..." Helped her as a person. When you're willing to change, iterate / adapt.

The Ross gif came though.

#### Q&A: signal / signal strength

Difficult questions: user feedback is the strongest indicator. Users: is this something you actually pay for? Pushing towards? Like?

Close second: team strengths. Works, but it's not our strengths, but we have to push through. VC said: shame you have to push through, it would be so much better if you played to your strengths... ok...

#### Q&A: how to users deal with pivots?

Usually pivots because users aren't using it, so ... eh? Brainstory open source: wait, that was a good product, but I can use it, good for you!

#### Q&A: how many of these are data-based vs gut?

Most are data based, but also trust your gut. If something doesn't feel right, there's a reason.

#### Q&A: AI?

AI is hype, hype will less

#### Q&A: did you manage to reuse the audience

Reused the audience, but still customers, because newsletter, "it's us again, hi!" if you're not interested, opt out, otherwise, go here, new stuff!

### talk 4: leah culver: from startup to -> tech giant and <- back

former ios lead at X. maybe hot sauce challenge

three startups with various levels of exit / shut down / etc.

#### how did you come up with the first startup

forums were a big popular thing, there was a website, pounds? pints? something. Microblogging. Concept of following people, ended up selling to blogging company to six apart.

#### then helped co-author oembed / oauth

because they came out from problems with pounce(?), made a public API because folks have asked for it. Needed to have new web standards, super happy dev house, ran into folks, thinking of ways for devs for users to log into third party sites (login with github, login with `<whatever>`), and then paste a link into pounce, and see a little snippet of what would it be.

#### what was the process?

12 people came up with the spec, she came late into the game, she made the first open source library, an actual implementation about it. Taking from oauth -> oembed, adoption. Talk to a bunch of people who they wanted to implement these, and then co-build the things with then. Random convo with youtube person: "you should impmlement oembed" - "what is it?" - "this" - "oh sure, I'll do it"

#### not a dev tool, why are you going for devs?

enablement! people want to interact with stuff

#### how did you approach devs to get them interested?

go to confs, meeting people in person, giving talks, starting newsletters, blogging, working collaboratively, listening to feedback!

#### change between pounce (2007) and now same process today

tools have changed: discord for comms with devs, different conferences, but the underlying principle is the same: communication of ideas, getting people involved. Use the tools at your disposal: have a newsletter, have a community, somewhere folks can reach out.

#### how honest are you with the community? 

if you think you made a mistake, do you tell them, or do you want to make your company look good? Tricky question: everyone's watching, but now it's more fessing up for things. Thanking people for contributing. Impressed how many people want to contribute to things that aren't theirs. "Thanks for paying attention so I don't need to do all of this!"

Be more open, dev open community is welcoming / supporting

#### Devs don't like building on top of APIs as much as back then

based on a quote from an interview. It's a case by case basis. If the product can benefit from external people, use them! There are entire businesses that are APIs. If your website doesn't _need_ an API, should you build it? Balance of "it takes time", vs "potentially not needed"

#### team graphql or rest

don't like graphql, is overkill. Rest api is nice.

#### growth

forums app, but live, topics... ? y combinator, got in, did y comb. [convore](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/convore)? looking through data: who is using this? Groups of friends, groups of interest ... ?

Already part of IRL social group -> moved it online
events were big
and weirdly business users

built a business app, so essentially slack before slack?

#### convore was on irc?

wasn't originally, but meeting people where they were, businesses were irc already on it

convore essentially decorated irc with useful things

look at the toolset available to users at the time

#### b2b software - own customers, wall... is going with an open protocol a better way?

walled garden is a recent trend - can't control the experience of users and ads on open waters, so walled garden

it depends on the context of what you're building, who you're building it to, but try to keep things open

#### would recommend y comb for new people?

100% absolutely recommend y comb, if it's the right time: small team, built something, gaining some traction. Better geared as b2b saas, because it's easy to measure. After 3 mo put in front of investors: before / after

no1 thing is network: batch, previous batch, new batch of fellow founders.

#### how do you use the y comb network?

beta testers are free! they're more likely to use a fellow y comb alum's stuff, honest feedback.

#### solo founder? (at y comb)

Sure, "team" can be the royal "we".

#### how did you find co-founders

For pounce, they found her, she lied "yes I can build it!" and then she did.

Second founder: knew each other before from django community.

Third co-founder from another conference.

#### Tech standpoint: django? Or do a cool kid thing and use a fancy tech?

Spicy question: right now: swift iphone apps... ? The best tool for the job over the tool I know best.

#### swift+apple: still good environment? their relationship with devs?

mixed, they're trying to be a great platform, but on the other side: 30% app store tax. She likes the restrictions, but understands that it's constrained. For ios it's more react native rather than swift. Cross-compatibility and ease of devving in react, or do you need to use native swift?

#### do you like swift as the language?

Yes, nice language, written by folks who have seen other languages.

#### third startup is "breaker"? how? acquisition? ran it for a while?

Started breaker after the podcast "serial / cereal"? Murder mystery story. Podcasting is gonna be huge! More of those great shows, contacted Eric, what do you think of podcasts? He was at soundcloud. Worked on a podcast listening app, but podcast wasn't the next big thing. There are a few big ones, but isn't what they thought, super hard, but plateud.

Raising series A, or ... ? Talked to a bunch of companies about being acquired. Twitter was working on something, covid happened, podcasts weren't being listened to (commute, cars). Twitter is gonna kill clubhouse. Twitter has the audience of thought leaders who command the written words. Wanted to work on twitter spaces, second ios developer, launched it 3-4 years ago.

Never worked on a product that killed the other product. It was fun!

#### what was twitter time like?

the person who printed out source code to show it to elon. She was spared the first layoff.

Linting project -> touched half the codebase -> OMG SHE WROTE HALF OF THE THINGS because Elon's people weren't start.

Printout: 3 people still in SF still writing code. Elon wants to see the code. Do I have to print it out...?

#### better for big co / startup?

It Depends™. Both have good opportunities:

* startup: move fast, do a lot, learn a lot, grow a lot, have to find product market fit
* big co: slow, not latest tech, may need to go into an office once in a while

#### what are you working on at the moment?

Unemployed at the moment, nothing to sell. :D
