# merge

Hell yeah merge conf berlin 13-14 june 2024.

## day 0

met with @techknowlogick (cofounder of gitea), chatted about gitea, startups, oss stuff, pricing, ads, investment

## day 1

venue is fantastic, teptrow arena berlin, wifi is fast, talks are about to kick off

### talk 0: intro

incredibly well done production, the sound is loud, crisp, but not overwhelming

### talk 1: why github was a success by tom preston-werner (@mojombo), co founder of github

giveaway of an apple vr thingy. we get to win it. github: 100mil+ devs and 1bil+ revenue. also created semver, also created toml. created toml while a little drunk one night. he invested in 145 companies since 2012, so he knows what goes, what doesn't.

Building dev tools is the conf for. Most important thing to have as a startup. (I think it's usecase / users). It's **product market fit**. Product market fit is actually just sparkling **a real problem you have figured out hot to solve**.

actual marketing page: "git repository hosting no longer a pain in the ass" (sic!). have a git repository and want to share it online? We do that! (controversy around swearing on home page :D)

if you can't explain your product in a few words, figure it out.

Also start small, then fuel over time. Github started in user groups, meetups, and go from there. icanhazruby. github is better than svn, lemme show how it works! -> conversations with the right people -> ruby on rails moved to github.

Find the niche to start with, serve that niche, then grow it.

Then meetups -> "drinkups". They went to bars (in SF), and then paid for folks' drinks -> lots of goodwill, and did it around the world to build up the userbase.

Met yahoo folks at a drinkup, and then they had an in to yahoo -> gave a talk at yahoo about github. Growing base of interested users.

But building a startup that doesn't have a product market fit? sisyphian effort.

#### Product market fit

**THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD BE DOING IN YOUR STARTUP IF YOU DON'T HAVE PRODUCT MARKET FIT IS TO FIND A PRODUCT MARKET FIT**

Idea about "virality". Decision around user / project to be first. User first, project second was the decision, and it was also super very important. Putting user first reduces barrier to entry (put up whatever project under your userspace whether it's useful or not).

"Fork you" shirt, back was `github.com/______` blank to be filled in by t-shirt wearer

Github would pay employees to go speak at confs to plant seeds because they'd share their github urls.

#### Bootstrapping

You need to make money with the thing in order to keep doing it. Gravatar is anti-example: lots of cost, no income.

Github started as a side project, needed a business model. GH business model: free for open source, pay for privacy.

Focus on the customer. If all of your money comes from them, take care of them.

Thrift makes you creative (need to save money). -> [How we made github fast](https://github.blog/2009-10-20-how-we-made-github-fast/) (october 20, 2009)

No need for a big fancy office.

Profitability is peace of mind, fundraising bandwagon is stress++.

Only hired people when they had the money to do so. Need to be efficient, because bootstrapping.

If you do have profitability, it gives you an insane amount of leverage against VCs. $100 mil first raise, they didn't _need_ to do that, therefore the VCs really wanna give you money. Write own term sheet, VCs can fill in the numbers.

#### Superfans

How to create GitHub superfans. How to surprise / delight / be weird / crazy about stuff. GitHub built a life sized oval office replica in a github office.

"I'm (gh customer) waiting for a meeting with X (GitHub) in their Oval fucking office!!!"

customer story: customer was angry, displeased about something. One of the employees started badmouthing the customer, that was shut down really quick. Something is wrong, then your product is not good enough. Let's solve it, customer emailed: "I'm sorry I was an asshole" -> sometimes becomes superfan.

#### Branding

Inspired by songbird. They had a character, a bird, doing things: farting always while doing things. Or the fail whale (twitter). So they went to images, to stock photo, and bought the original octocat for $5, octo puss. Super pixely, like 120x78? :D

Then started putting it on to stuff, decorating the octo cat. They hired full time artists to draw octo cats, then stickers, shirts, scotch glasses, etc.

YouTube: digital ocean video on DO's account, but they have an octo cat sticker on the animated laptop :D. Tattoos of octo cats.

#### Values

It's not about branding, or github-the-corporation. They do it because getting a tat, or a sticker or whatever is a secret handshake, a declaration of values, a belonging, some commonality. If you (the audience) wear a github t-shirt, have a github sticker, why do you do this? What does it mean for people / users to identify with your brand? Octo cat - I know you, you're into open source, you're into development, you're into the same things that I am.

"Care only about what your users think of themselves as a result of interacting with your creation." - Kathy Sierra

Metrics - measure the things your users care about. Or "give users a way to kick ass." - Kathy Sierra -> virality

#### Dogfooding

(when I find out there's 60g of protein in dog food - kylo: I know what must be done but I don't know if I have the strength to do it)

Dogfooding isn't a thing outside of tech apparently. Apparently started by a pet food company where an exec in a board meeting actually ate their dog food to demonstrate how good that is.

Using github to build github. All employees had to _pay_ for github, because if they didn't they'd miss the "paying for the github" experience (they would be reimbursed). You want to know if there's an issue with the billing system.

Culture of shipping. Shipit squirrel is also a Scott (MC) story. Shipping code to users is the goal, software is never done, never perfect, but it can be shipped, and it can get into the hands of users to create value.

6 mo to ship first publicly available version of github.

#### Internal tools

Build your own things! (some of those ended up being billion $$$ startups independently from them)

#### Beware the hype train

Powerset - natural language search engine. Ship things, and underperform, and lost the goodwill of the community.

Magic Leap - lots of money, lots of hype, but super undeerwhelming. They could never achieve what their marketing said.

vs oculus: they had crappy slow versions, then iterated, they told users that these are dev versions, therefore not expect much. 

Only company that can ship perfect stuff immediately is apple, because infinite money. "We invented a thing that changes the world forever, and you can buy it today!!" - hyped it for like 30 seconds.

Vision Pro is weird, because they need to talk about things (maybe FCC req?) - but is it hyped?

**REPUTATION ISN'T BUILT ON WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO, IT'S BUILT ON WHAT YOU DO**

#### Optimizing for happiness

What's the point (of building the company)? Invest in people, and let them be great. Flat hierarchy, distributed, not a lot of managers.

Book reco: Daniel H. Pink - Drive

People -> Process -> Product

#### Q&A

##### How did the idea of github even start?

At powerset - git is amazing, and then we can sync it with subversion! Poll from user accounts on linux, etc. Git was awesome, but it was super inaccessible to anyone, because it was very much locked away, set up linux user account for your people, etcetcetc.

But I'm a web developer, and I know other web devs, so we can solve this, and abstract away the pain.

##### Are you (tom werner-preston) still writing code?

Side projects, little box, dial, nfc card, url of a music album, device is bound to sonos speaker, so microcontroller code for that, occasionally, but for the project that he's involved in, he's a designer.

### talk 2: Fireside chat with david cramer: david vs GNUliath

About open source, running an open source company.

#### Where did it all begin?

Just build stuff, internet is accessible, you just build somehting, put it out there, source forge, google code, github, etc. Open source was more of a community thing, so OSS just made sense.

#### Where does the passion come from?

Sentry is ~400 people, so he finds new things about it and argue with people about it on twitter/x. Cares less about the _ideals_ and more about access to tech, access to software, what the internet is /was: big open platform. Access should remain a thing for folks. He kept open sourcing things, and people just let him.

Sentry took some loud and controversial opinions about open source. It's just a distribution model for businesses, but also access as well.

#### Started as django-db-log, how, where?

Django community, contribute a lot to django events. Solved a particular issue for a particular thing.

linux evangelism is weird, doesn't care about it.

This is not interesting...

#### How did you know that django-db-log would take off?

Built stuff that solved a problem. Worked at disqus (comments) at the time. Positive feedback loop, disqus used OSS libraries he's written, and he wanted to bootstrap a co around it. Customers from day 1 because they hosted it for others.

#### ??? don't remember the question

Copied the pricing of the one competitor, so they wanted to make it affordable, and then they iterated around it a lot. Goal: to be THE default for the thing they're doing. If you're an enterprise only tool, you can't be the default. If you charge a lot, you can't be the default.

Pricing now: the more errors you have, the more money you pay.

#### Business models around open source

Right now we're at another inflexion point in open source: different value sets exist. The open source foundation is essentially a religion. Commercially protected open source, or fair-source.

Open source is a distribution model, not a business model. If it's a distribution model, you need to fund it. How do you have some degree of protection?

The way sentry survives is the funding from the company. There's no charity. There's the risk of other companies taking your thing, and running you with it.

Functional-source licence: we build the IP, you can host it, but can't compete with it. In 2 years it becomes permissive.

Sentry's approach to commercialising open source will not work for everyone. Sentry: cares about open source, but rubber meets road, so others can't be selling their thing.

#### capitalism

[healthy dose of capitalism](https://cra.mr/open-source-and-a-healthy-dose-of-capitalism) - there's an opportunity to make money. We're not the starving artists, we're the tech industry. Ethically conscious way of earning money: give back (code, money).

If you contribute to sentry, there'll be an email: "we'll pay you for your work you do because it brings us value." It's always win-win. $500k given away for OSS developers. That's less than one month for adsense. Have to have the ROI for it.

Licensing, funding model, distribution are all important decisions.

#### what are the lines don't wanna cross

Failure: hashicorp - they are not driven by first party, they rely on third parties to push them forward, selfish to change licence.  They're protecting the IP.

Very large corps: take open source things, repackage, and sell it. The builders should still be rewarded. Lot of technology relies on charity.

Prometheus is an example: a LOT of companies rely on it for a lot of their revenue, but do they reward it back? No.

(I kinda see NGINX here as one of this)

#### How did you end up with functional source licence

Legal / illegal things? The only protection is just trademarks, which is very weak.

There was a company that tried to ship sentry as part of their stack, but not pay sentry for this. Switched business-source licence: for up to 4 years under the proprietary licence, after 4 years it can turn into whatever.

Sentry wasn't happy with BSL. FSL is no variability, fixed: you cannot commercialise it for 2 years, and then it's apache.

Copyleft, but that has chilling effect (forces ideals on users), or open-core, which is part closed-source, and usually closed-source is what you want.

The 2 years - forces to innovate.

FSL can be learned, and not need individual legal review again and again.

#### what was the response to FSL?

been good. fundamentalists are bad, because the practicality dies. they are loud - folks just want free software. Third party ecosystems thrive because of this.

library: you should have access to books, use it, but shouldn't reprint books and sell them.

#### fair-source licence?

Launches soon, try to fix the open source footgun. ROI is marketing.

#### question

open source is a tip jar: reward people with money that do work for you. Sustainability is important: to give work away for free: rewarded, and not exploited.

#### is AI fixing problems?

protip: do not use AI because it doesn't produce code, it gives you snippets -> leads to blackouts. Gimmicky AI, like everyone

#### LLMs on thinking about open source

Use LLMs to use semantic matching. Fingerprinting erros, grouping the same kind together, etc, LLMs are good about this one. They are not _safe_, so you need to train the models on what you wanna do, but using them exposes the risk of exposing the training data. None of us want the business data exposed. Privacy is very very very important.

Open source is wild west, a lot of things are called open source that aren't.


### talk 3: embracing the pivot: an engineering perspective on adaptability by cassidy williams

talk was a surprise, not the ross-meme (PIVOT!!), change is inevitable, so startup journey

Previously: CTO of contentda, right now it's just dev advocate.

Startup started with stickers: physically mailing stickers to people. Mailing the most number of streams on twitch to scale stickers to everyone on the streams.

Pivot: stream subscribers, how to retain them on the platform? Working, but ... what to do with the data?

Creator resurfacing content: you tweeted this a year ago, wanna recreate it?

Creator recreating content: video -> blog post, or video -> tweet thread, AI thing

Technical creators reusing content -> take a tech blog post, and turn it into a tweet thread, or take a tech talk -> tutorial

Then tech industry did a chaos

Took the API for transforming media, to prompted text:
    * high schoolers writing college essays -> talk at bot, suggest stuff back but not solve the things

Turned into "Brain story", and it would help you flesh out the thing, but it's now open source, you can use it, but it's been spun down.

When pivoting: which part can I salvage, which part do I throw away? Is this future proof, or completely rewrite as if it's temporary?

#### Mindset shift

Love what we build! I created it, I AM A GOD! But the code is just a thing we made, your work is not permanent. This is a good thing, do NOT be attached to things, because spiral of "I WILL MAKE THIS WORK", which leads to sunk cost fallacy, so we keep doing it even though we should stop and ... pivot?

"The most dangerous phrase in the language is: we've always done it this way." - Grace Hopper

If it ain't broken, don't fix it, but sometimes it's broken under the surface and it does need changing.

Pivoting is common: 1 in 3 startups does it.

https://cass.run/pivots

Leny's Newsletter (TK - look it up)

#### You should be building flexible systems

* actual code components
* data you have
* parts of an idea
* processes

Pivots:

stickers: we pulled the details to send out stickers, so what if we could use some other part of the data we already got to resurfacing

"I don't wanna resurface content, but it would be cool if I could use it to create new content!" - customer feedback

Take what we have, refine to technical -> recreate, then gpt4 came out

then underlying API can be used for other things

take bits, pieces, feedback, parts to make it work for the next phase.

They got really good at mindset shift. Yes, we wanna say "yes we are 100% in in this idea" - to investors, but we also need to be ready to shift mindsets because nothing is permanent. Get to "good enough", see if it works, if it doesn't, don't spend time perfecting the good enough further.

Ask a lot of **scary questions**:

* has our growth stalled? Is it just not good enough for our users?
* Is retention low? "Well, that's neat, good for you, bye"
* is interest lukewarm? folks tried because they liked them as people
* is it just not good enough?

"seven months in, we only made $600" - shahed Khan, co-founder Loom

"The whole thing didn't make any sense" - Steve Chen, co-founder YouTube, used to be a dating platform

"why is everything AI, I am so tired" - Cassidy Williams, now

This can be also about own projects:

* are systems or processes working? Is the issue tracking working? Is this process of retros working? Should we change it?
* is your codebase ... good? Sometimes it's just... bad. Net promoter score: is the code good? -100 from all engineers. If the engineers don't wanna work on it, they're not gonna.
* if you continue building this way, will your team be successful? - copying api endpoints to make shit work.

fill this out:


        |  like    | don't like
good at | prioritize | optimize, don't do too much, automate
not good at | learning | delegate, burnout happens here

learning: don't ship stuff here

#### Pivots are scary

Process, but also the thing. It's about the journey. (cliche) If you focus on the exit, or 100 mil users, then it's easy to get discouraged when you hit setbacks. Learn through iterations. If you focus on the end, you're not focusing / enjoying the journey.

#### Pivots have made her better

Better ideas, better planning, better teammate, better founder. "Have to say no again..." Helped her as a person. When you're willing to change, iterate / adapt.

The Ross gif came though.

#### Q&A: signal / signal strength

Difficult questions: user feedback is the strongest indicator. Users: is this something you actually pay for? Pushing towards? Like?

Close second: team strengths. Works, but it's not our strengths, but we have to push through. VC said: shame you have to push through, it would be so much better if you played to your strengths... ok...

#### Q&A: how to users deal with pivots?

Usually pivots because users aren't using it, so ... eh? Brainstory open source: wait, that was a good product, but I can use it, good for you!

#### Q&A: how many of these are data-based vs gut?

Most are data based, but also trust your gut. If something doesn't feel right, there's a reason.

#### Q&A: AI?

AI is hype, hype will less

#### Q&A: did you manage to reuse the audience

Reused the audience, but still customers, because newsletter, "it's us again, hi!" if you're not interested, opt out, otherwise, go here, new stuff!

### talk 4: leah culver: from startup to -> tech giant and <- back

former ios lead at X. maybe hot sauce challenge

three startups with various levels of exit / shut down / etc.

#### how did you come up with the first startup

forums were a big popular thing, there was a website, pounds? pints? something. Microblogging. Concept of following people, ended up selling to blogging company to six apart.

#### then helped co-author oembed / oauth

because they came out from problems with pounce(?), made a public API because folks have asked for it. Needed to have new web standards, super happy dev house, ran into folks, thinking of ways for devs for users to log into third party sites (login with github, login with `<whatever>`), and then paste a link into pounce, and see a little snippet of what would it be.

#### what was the process?

12 people came up with the spec, she came late into the game, she made the first open source library, an actual implementation about it. Taking from oauth -> oembed, adoption. Talk to a bunch of people who they wanted to implement these, and then co-build the things with then. Random convo with youtube person: "you should impmlement oembed" - "what is it?" - "this" - "oh sure, I'll do it"

#### not a dev tool, why are you going for devs?

enablement! people want to interact with stuff

#### how did you approach devs to get them interested?

go to confs, meeting people in person, giving talks, starting newsletters, blogging, working collaboratively, listening to feedback!

#### change between pounce (2007) and now same process today

tools have changed: discord for comms with devs, different conferences, but the underlying principle is the same: communication of ideas, getting people involved. Use the tools at your disposal: have a newsletter, have a community, somewhere folks can reach out.

#### how honest are you with the community? 

if you think you made a mistake, do you tell them, or do you want to make your company look good? Tricky question: everyone's watching, but now it's more fessing up for things. Thanking people for contributing. Impressed how many people want to contribute to things that aren't theirs. "Thanks for paying attention so I don't need to do all of this!"

Be more open, dev open community is welcoming / supporting

#### Devs don't like building on top of APIs as much as back then

based on a quote from an interview. It's a case by case basis. If the product can benefit from external people, use them! There are entire businesses that are APIs. If your website doesn't _need_ an API, should you build it? Balance of "it takes time", vs "potentially not needed"

#### team graphql or rest

don't like graphql, is overkill. Rest api is nice.

#### growth

forums app, but live, topics... ? y combinator, got in, did y comb. [convore](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/convore)? looking through data: who is using this? Groups of friends, groups of interest ... ?

Already part of IRL social group -> moved it online
events were big
and weirdly business users

built a business app, so essentially slack before slack?

#### convore was on irc?

wasn't originally, but meeting people where they were, businesses were irc already on it

convore essentially decorated irc with useful things

look at the toolset available to users at the time

#### b2b software - own customers, wall... is going with an open protocol a better way?

walled garden is a recent trend - can't control the experience of users and ads on open waters, so walled garden

it depends on the context of what you're building, who you're building it to, but try to keep things open

#### would recommend y comb for new people?

100% absolutely recommend y comb, if it's the right time: small team, built something, gaining some traction. Better geared as b2b saas, because it's easy to measure. After 3 mo put in front of investors: before / after

no1 thing is network: batch, previous batch, new batch of fellow founders.

#### how do you use the y comb network?

beta testers are free! they're more likely to use a fellow y comb alum's stuff, honest feedback.

#### solo founder? (at y comb)

Sure, "team" can be the royal "we".

#### how did you find co-founders

For pounce, they found her, she lied "yes I can build it!" and then she did.

Second founder: knew each other before from django community.

Third co-founder from another conference.

#### Tech standpoint: django? Or do a cool kid thing and use a fancy tech?

Spicy question: right now: swift iphone apps... ? The best tool for the job over the tool I know best.

#### swift+apple: still good environment? their relationship with devs?

mixed, they're trying to be a great platform, but on the other side: 30% app store tax. She likes the restrictions, but understands that it's constrained. For ios it's more react native rather than swift. Cross-compatibility and ease of devving in react, or do you need to use native swift?

#### do you like swift as the language?

Yes, nice language, written by folks who have seen other languages.

#### third startup is "breaker"? how? acquisition? ran it for a while?

Started breaker after the podcast "serial / cereal"? Murder mystery story. Podcasting is gonna be huge! More of those great shows, contacted Eric, what do you think of podcasts? He was at soundcloud. Worked on a podcast listening app, but podcast wasn't the next big thing. There are a few big ones, but isn't what they thought, super hard, but plateud.

Raising series A, or ... ? Talked to a bunch of companies about being acquired. Twitter was working on something, covid happened, podcasts weren't being listened to (commute, cars). Twitter is gonna kill clubhouse. Twitter has the audience of thought leaders who command the written words. Wanted to work on twitter spaces, second ios developer, launched it 3-4 years ago.

Never worked on a product that killed the other product. It was fun!

#### what was twitter time like?

the person who printed out source code to show it to elon. She was spared the first layoff.

Linting project -> touched half the codebase -> OMG SHE WROTE HALF OF THE THINGS because Elon's people weren't start.

Printout: 3 people still in SF still writing code. Elon wants to see the code. Do I have to print it out...?

#### better for big co / startup?

It Depends™. Both have good opportunities:

* startup: move fast, do a lot, learn a lot, grow a lot, have to find product market fit
* big co: slow, not latest tech, may need to go into an office once in a while

#### what are you working on at the moment?

Unemployed at the moment, nothing to sell. :D

### LUNCH BREAK

Super confusing

### talk 5: Igniting communities: scaling from zero to one million - jana iris: former director of community hashicorp / investor at TQ ventures

#### How did you get started? background in legal

Did a whole "turn to your partner you don't know" thing which I absolutely hated. Bringin community together in a very authentic way. This was not authentic. Or rather I don't find this authentic.

graduated 2008, no job, moved home to sf, first tech job, engine yard, ror hosting company. got introduced to open source. Hosted meetups, hired some of the contributors, they sponsored hashimoto while he was working on vagrant.

#### Where did hashicorp started?

Ended at 12 mo at 250mm downloads. Hashi folks invited Jana to organise the first meetup when hashicorp was 8. Same same, early users, individual developers, cool kids working at fortune 500 cos, etc and talked to them when terraform was freshly open sourced.

She launched a bunch of community programmes, there wasn't roi, because that's not the point. Verbal and written style guide. Hashicorp brand was pragmatic, prfessional, grammar guide, so same style in customer service tickets, newsletters, blogs.

#### At what point should you hire for a dir of community?

Key early, or later is fine? Usually folks follow a playbook "this is when I need to launch a ____", whereas if you have authentic decisions, that's better because communities are different. Dir of community can be an engineer who's embedded into the community.

#### key attribs for the person to do community?

empathy and authenticity. How do I design a programme based on how people are going to engage with it? Pandemic, at home, break concentration, so 20 minute talks, breaks, recorded... Also no techno, bright lights, at 9am. A brand is also a vibe.

#### community vs devrel?

community with a capital c encompasses devrel, community (small c), etc... sometimes folks think it's just the tactics. At hashi it's a holistic view on how to engage with folks, and then you build programmes around it. devrel activities are different than what a community manager does

#### 5 pillars: (TK look it up) education, knowledge sharing, ... ?? where from?

5 pillars apply to anyone building tools / community for developers.

Education is key, it's important, great docs, tutorials, talks.
Knowledge sharing is peer to peer. Get other people to talk about hashicorp. How folks use the tools you built? The meetups are useful for this.

#### If you're a new company, getting started, which one should you focus on of the 5?

It's hard, because budget, resources, time... new relic had to give away 90% of the tickets because no one wanted to come, but vcs said you should make a user conference.

#### early customers: how to get first key influencers

series A in 2014: 2 years to get open source adoption. Then they didn't need to worry about monetization. Individual users - elegant tools for them, but commercial users had a different pain points.

Used open source to get into commercial side of things.

#### many touchpoints to gain trust, one to destroy it

devs have a set toolkit. To get someone to trust your thing to try your thing, it requires a lot of trust and work. Tried to look bigger and more professional than they actually were. They wanted people to know that they'll be around in a while. Adopt a technology and they go under in a year, what's the point?

#### how do you destroy developer trust?

first user conf, 350 people came. They didn't treat them as leads, created lasting relationships with them, they because core contribs, employees, biggest customers.

building community -> monetization -> sending emails, becoming pushy -> hurting goodwill.

#### social media: thoughts on how to leverage it in 2024?

lot of news from newsletters. twitter, hackernews, reddit... you have to change, but twitter is still a dev haven apparently.

#### what's the point of the volume of stuff you're done?

It's expensive: you need a team, costs associated with it. But the reason: create channels for useful feedback, you want people to talk to you, to share, to have empathy. Plus the more people talk about you, the better.

#### early adopters are fine to start, but how to make them stick?

product market fit. See railway, the way he's built the devex, you need the a-ha! moments! The "I understand what you're doing!" moments.

Very quickly need to understand what the product is, how to get started. You should know where you are, where to go next, every 2-3 minutes there's an a-ha moment.

#### how do you start the communication to the communities?

first 2 years founders spent the majority of time on planes, they knew the first 1000 users by name. Going to meetups, being active on twitter. She hand wrote notes and sent them along with stickers to folks who wrote about hashicorp (blogs or whatever).

If you don't think of community as a lead gen, you can build a good community.

#### talk about the hashicorp licence change

what did the licence change feel like? she wasn't there for this already. IPO: "thank you for our open source community" on a huge billboard at times square. How the tools took off _because_ the open source.

at the same time, hashi wasn't the first who did change their licence: mongo, etc...

At the end of the day it was rug pulling. "I thought I was contributing to an open source thing, but you're no longer that"

Even though 99% people weren't impacted, but it still hurt the dev trust

#### How could this have been done better?

The way they communicated the change was fucked up, so the change made sense, but the communication was shit. Key people should have been notified first, and then rolled out slowly.

#### what's an advice for new founders

marketing or product? You need to have product market fit: if the product isn't found or isn't immediately usable on what it's for

Authentic: want to solve their problems.

#### Q&A: biggest mistake that instantly alienates a community you've seen

So many... rug pulling, hurting developer trust. Leah was talking about the apple ecosystem, she likes the 30%, but ... is it?

#### Q&A what do you do when the community manager leaves? How do you not hinge everything on them?

Devrel may build their own personal brand as well, so there needs to be someone who wants to build the company brand as well: involve engineers as well. Not just have one person that links company to community. The community person's job is to draw links between company and community.

### talk 6: Robby Russel: oh my zsh(it): bringin delight to the cli

pretty much everyone is familiar with oh my zsh. Contributions from 2400 contributions, 2600 forks, lots of stars... (vanity metrics). Business model: make no money

How did it get started? Maybe it'll save time.

* How do you pronounce it?
* how did you think of it? What inspired you, what motivated it?

Ruby on Rails introduced him to zsh (the shell) instead of bash. Trading and sharing little snippets and stuff on irc and pasty.

Most of the people used bash.

> Hell is other people - Jean-Paul Sartre

I like using cool shit. Carlos likes to understand why shit is cool.

Robby understood 30-40% of the config file.

zsh config file, clean up, documentation.

git init -> moved into small messy files -> ??? -> switched to zsh

Next step:

> How do I change the colors?

What are you taling about, I have the best color pallet, this is beautiful.

Okay, so he walked him through this how to modify the prompt.zsh

so themes started to be a thing to deal with git conflicts. same with plugins.

reach out: hey it's cool, but it assumes ruby, how do I handle python?

So they moved the ruby stuff into a directory. So 70+ plugins and 100+ themes got added from others.

There are 353 PRs at the moment. Most are from first time contributors.

#### Why was this successful?

Theories:

* incredibly easy to try. Immediately looks great
* not intimidating: just a dollar symbol the default. zsh: more info, junior devs know what's happening
* continuous updates: cli updated itself via git, which was cool, no versioning system
* perfect timing, just popped up when git was a thing, and people started using playgrounds more and more
* word of mouth, people seem to like it. Folks are constantly writing articles about it, but also content to NOT use it
* luck
* maybe because of robby himself? been releasing projects for over a decade, so he knew how launching stuff works

#### Lessons learned

1. vision not required. There was no plan, no inspiration. Motivated to convince like 4 other people, because it would be convenient.
1. build playgrounds, a friendly space for the community to experiment. Welcomed ideas from community, it was ours (community's), not his
1. packaging matters. Sharing dotfiles is easy, but he added a bunch of extra, called it something, put a lot of effort to make things look more official.
1. curate is more important than creator for him. If folks are pitching, you need to figure out how that's gonna impact users. Need to develop a sense of taste. Figure out what should be incorporated into the core project vs plugin / theme.
1. always notice the helpers, and appreciate the contribution, regardless of whether you're accepting the change or not
1. collaborators need vision, so you do need to figure out what the vision is: junior developers are the target user base, and then once that was clarified, then collaborators can be invited.
1. solve problems, obviously. Sustainability and easy maintenance are super very very important. Obvious practical solutions on regular basis

He gets paid to untangle complicated but really clever things.

When he created, he didn't think it would become this big, he just wanted to make the workday easier. It was an internal tool that got shared with the world.

#### The future

meant to make the work easier, productive, delightful. Contributions, no matter how small or uninspiring, can be a big impact.

[maintainable.fm](https://maintainable.fm)


#### Q&A: do you think oh my zsh helped zsh adoption leading to apple adopting zsh as default?

Google trends. ZSH core devs don't like omz because folks confuse the two. It was surprising that apple announced zsh to be default. Don't think it _lead_ to this.

#### Q&A: editor, customization of?

VSCode, obscure called jo, no idea how to use emacs. Not super elaborate customization of code.

#### Q&A: how do you ensure that a change in plugin is correct?

Got an email from nasa, security people: can you confirm if people from these countries contribute code? Dunno, not got paid enough for this. Docker, run tests, conscious about checking the code, but there's a lot of tooling or testing that exists.

#### Q&A: what fundamental early decisions shaped?

Not taking itself too seriously. It has a personality. Very on the hook on how to talk, but omz is its own thing, so he can play with it instead of worrying about clients / customers.

## day 2

### talk 1: the early days of id software: programming principles by john romero

they wer in their twenties, not known limits. Lots of arcade gaming. apple ][ computer.

sophomore in high school, 15 yo, software stuff for the air force. classified stuff. he made 74 games, 3 games companies: capitol ideas software, inside out, ideas from the deep, he was 21.

softdisk: gamer's edge. Then john carmack, adrian carmack (no relation), tom hall, plus john romero, each made games on their own. Dangerous dave in copyright infringement. Smooth scrolling on PC, big eureka moment.

Made super mario 3 on pc, nintendo didn't publish on pc, so they reused the tech for commander keen.

pc has been out for 9 years, no one has done the smooth scrolling.

Cmdr Keen led to the concept of game engines. They were engines operating on different data. So keen 4 dev they also licenced the engine to others.

id software founded feb 1 1991

shadow nights, keens, catacomb, tiles of the dragon, rescue rover,s , dangerous daves

#### Core principles

##### No prototypes

Came up with the idea -> made the game. No prototypes. Make game, polish as you go, don't depend on polish happening later, always contain constantly shippable code.

##### Always run

Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults upon load failure. It's incredibly important thatt your game can always be run by your team.

MIssing sprite? -> show bagel
missing soundtrack? -> play something obviously wrong

##### Keep your code absolutely simple

Keep looking at your functions and figure out how to simplify further

##### Great tools help make great games

Spend as much time on tools as possible.

Made a TED - Title Editor, 33 shipped games.

> Wolfenstein 3d took 4 months to shareware (1 episode), additional 2 months for the rest of the story + handbook.

##### Own the testing

Don't waste other people's time, test thoroughly before checking your code, only the team should see bugs or see the game crash (lol).

##### See a bug? Fix it immediately

If you don't immediately fix a thing, new code is based on buggy code.

##### Use a dev system that is superior to your target

Dev DOS -> Game DOS, before doom.

Dev: NEXT workstations -> game dos: for doom.

> Had to learn the hardware of nintendo, so it took us 3 weeks to rewrite wolfenstein 3d for nintendo.

Quick story 2: On a couple computers the game froze, but everywhere else it ran. Fix was found, the bug was in the game from the start. Something about the menu and game stopping.

9 devs on quake.

##### Write for this game only, not for future games

YAGNI. Future games you'll be smarter.

##### Encapsulate

Functionality encapsulated to ensure design consistency, this minimizes mistakes and saves design time. Torch is an entity that is made up of the geometry, fire, sound.

> Quake found the Pentium FDIV bug :D

##### Code transparently

Tell them how you're going to solve problems, do not treat solutions as black boxes. The project would go off the rails and cause delays.

If you're working on a bug for more than 20 minutes, tell someone else.

> 40 minutes, "I can't fix this, so here's what's happening...", other person halfway through the sentence told him what the issue was.

##### Q&A: what was the challenge for with side scrolling

was EGA, was frame buffer, EGA it was 1 byte for 8 pixels, but 4 bits stacked in memory, VGA instead 1 byte -> 1 pixel.

8 pixel scrolling was the norm. unless you had the documentation, in which case you knew about CTRC to set the offset, which bit in the byte you wanted it to.

##### Q&A: how do you feel about people running doom on any and all hardware

Doom on Fridge :D. Pregnancy test, tesla, piano, bacteria...

##### Q&A: fave game of the ones you created

DOOM: still creating games for it, Sigil 1 and Sigil 2, the original 1993 doom. Source ports. Working on Hellion, new Doom 2 pack (32 levels).

New FPS, 60 people, unannounced yet.

##### Q&A: how did you come up with the idea of shareware?

Wasn't their idea.

1987 the origin, when they released keen 1990 as shareware, the publisher was a shareware pioneer (apogee). You need to have three games, in episodes, first episode as shareware, fully free, cliffhanger, so they want to buy the continuing. Today's Free to play is shareware, and mtx is the rest. Or DLC.

##### Q&A: without vcs, how did you manage working on same things

Floppy disks, only 2 programmers, so when they were working on stuff, they worked on separate files. And then just talked and kept talking with each other.

### talk 2: fireside chat with jay simons: from startup to IPO, the atlassian journey

Hot sauce challenge. Dipping pretzels into it.

Github office, piano, Jay Simons, playing piano in Rangoon, Burma. Almost every day playing piano.

GitHub and BitBucket (Atlassian) is... hm...

Fight hard with respect.

Celebrate the accomplishments of a competitor.

#### Atlassian had hipchat, which got sold to slack. Why did you sell a product that was doing fairly well?

Not doing well enough. Hard to admit defeat, and had a friendly relationship with slack. Respectful competition: never bad mouthed them, never been jerks to them.

To Slack: We wanna exit the chat thing from hipchat, we have customers where they picked hipchat over slack. Deal was made, path forward was found.

#### There was a conversation for Atlassian to acquire GitHub

They debated it internally for a couple of months. Atlassian wanted to, tried to get GitHub.

#### Atlassian early days, similar trajectories, both bootstrapped, big rounds much later, didn't need it

Atlassian went IPO, GitHub went MS. How did the trajecotry come about? Came from Mike and Scott, founders of Atlassian, who've not worked in a different company, they founded it in college. The curiousity of "is this the best way"? Culture of "why are you doing it THAT way?" is it an always done it that way, or have you really thought about it? That culture led to processes, pricing...

> They are struggling with the hot sauces :D

#### Rethink enterprise sales

Threw everything away and rethought sales. No sales until 2014 or 2015. Low pricing, so you don't need to ask boss, flywheel of dev sales. If you were a huge enterprise with unlimited thing, $3500 max per year. Anything above you would have needed sales people.

No need for sales brokerage. As sales, you want to put friction between customer and product, pre-qualification, etcetc.

Ethos: get out of the customer's way, let the product sell itself, do not add friction.

#### First principles: were there things where this failed?

Lots of organisational building and HR. At some point they didn't have titles, but at some point it got confusing. You were "head of ...", at some point that got "global head of ..."

Having titles is kind of useful for an org above a size. Hiring got hard without titles too.

At github they also wanted to throw away titles, because it didn't matter to founders, but other folks told them that it did matter.

#### Bootstrapped, but investor now, so clearly see the value injecting money

Should a new company bootstrap, ask for VC? Why? Why not? If you can bootstrap, why wouldn't you? Do it! Don't need to take a mortgage out on the company (VC money) if you don't have to, because you retain ownership. No primary equity for investors before IPO. Atlassian founders at IPO had 80+%.

VS raising money all the time rather than building product, then founders end up with single digit ownership %.

A lot of software, especially dev tools businesses, it's a totally reasonable path to not need a lot of money to build something of value, so it gets to profitability.

Measuring _everything_, marketing, open a japan office, what's the ROI of whatever? A lot of companies flush with capital just spend a bunch of capital without thinking about it.

Zero interest rate created a mentality that money gets spent, and when you run out of it, just ask for more and you'll get more.

#### IPO stats? ARR stats?

15 mil profitable 80 people
IPO: 6000 people, 3 bil profitable.

#### How do you maintain culture?

> hot sauce: Scott: "I've done this a couple of times because I'm not smart

Office was fun. Atlassian offices are fun in SF. How did you go from 80 people to 6000 people to keep trust / fun?

Hire carefully: wanted to hire people that were different in the right ways, but same in the other right ways. If you grow, you wanna retain "the best times."

Talked about not wanting to be the same company at different sizes, so you need to change the company for different sizes, so the holiday party won't work at 300 the same as 100 people.

Open company no bullshit, so no executives know one thing, everyone else know a different thing.

Hipchat, made them insiders, so they can tell material non-public information: before hipchat was sold, told employees, about 300 people, "can't guarantee you'll have jobs, but trust us that we'll do our best to take care of you."

#### One of the other values is "don't fuck the customer"

What does this mean for the company of 6000? Live through examples, and reinforce them.

Atlassian doesn't discount for anyone which is weird for enterprises. Customers expect discounts, but no. Reason: if we give you a discount, then we're effing every other customers. Same with contract terms that are the same across all customers.

#### Inestor later stage

Advice: what are the biggest things other companies can learn from atlassian?

Culture matters: why do you do things you do? Value systems. Effect on the poeple you hire. Reinforce the type of people joining the company.

The earlier you build a system that can self replicate, the better, when it comes to a size where the founders aren't connected to.

#### Q&A: now that you're wearing the venture hat, how is it different from operating a company

Investing is lonely. It's more like a swim team than a soccer team. Feedback cycle when operating a company is so short, investing is 5-7 years.

Scott: interesting to see the 10 different

#### Q&A: What was the secret sauce that made JIRA won than competitors

Faster, better, cheaper, and if you're all three, you might not still win, but pick one and attack the competitor on that. If competitor is slow, be faster. If competitor is expensive, be cheaper.

#### Q&A: Bitbucket or GitHub, which one is your fave?

Not answered :D

#### Q&A: RTO?

Atlassian is a remote first company now. It's 10k employees, the notion of being in an office is different. Old fashioned: young company: same place, same time. Atlassian would not have existed without in-office starts. Got to know the people, care about the others. Like the advantages of working from home, but it can turn your job into something that's transactional and soulless.

The glue that helps build a company happens in-person.

### talk 3: beyond the feed: reshaping community in the digital era by saron yitbarek

flatiron school in ny in 2013 the first time she encountered tech. code, fail, grow. good community. but bothered that that costs a lot of money. where was the community for folks who couldn't pay $$$?

So she wanted to create comms: twitte chats: using hashtags at specified times, it was like a live group chat there.

twitter chats: no cost, no physical limits, all you had to do was be awake and online, hashtag #codenewbie

lots of cold and warm outreach to help the spread of #codenewbie. lot of folks did help. 

Codenewbie became an entity / company: launched podcasts: codenewbie, basecs, plus the conference: codeland, and a newsletter, plus forum.

home base was always twitter.

Twitter then got eloned. Folks in response: revolt, left, but ... not the sale was the reason. Everything would be just inevitable.

Tiktok's for you page were getting important.

Can't _talk_ to them, can't _reach_ them, pretty much strangers. She missess the old feed.

#### Where you call home is important

borrowed audience is short term, you never know when the rules will change, rugs will be pulled.

Social media platforms are no longer safe places to build online, it's good to spread the word

Sold codenewbie in 2019, started DISCO.

use skills and expertise to generate multiple streams of income. BCM - oh, big cash money!

Jack Conte: death of the follower ted talk.

Following: I wanna follow X, I get X as content

Replaced by **The Feed**, which is ... not who you follow, but what keeps you engaged.

Biggest regrets: content with meeting people where they were, but did not appreciate the risk that that posed: rules change, lose access. Did not build direct connection, a mailing list.

seeding community is leveraging an audience. Borrowed audiences are too risky to rely on. Only folks who follow you on your ground.

so started with folks on the newsletter, manual outreach. BCM had a business purpose.

started BCM: start a campfire, a reason to come back.

Monday async standups: this is what I wanna do
friday feelings: how the week went, here's what I'm gonna do next week

Step further, so discord.

Hired a growth and accountability coach: job is to hang out with the members, and be a cheerleader.

community, weekly events, coaching for free first BCM thingy.

300 applications -> 35 people, so three cohorts (100 people?)

metrics: participation, number of replies

closed community: started at 100%, then declined
quality of the participation: everyone came ALL the way. Nothing was off limits, covered everything both business and personal.

#### The dip

There was a dip, there was a feedback form, and folks filled it out. Expected scores to be low, but high overall satisfaction.

So if the scores were high, why weren't people showing up? Wrong metric. Wrong way to look at communities.

There was a core group of people doing the talking, but there's a larger circle of lurkers, and they're also part of the community. Community is not just the folks who _actively_ engage. Community is not just the people who engage. It's a space to participate. Lurking is a form of participating.

Communities is not a group class where everyone does the same thing. It's a gym where people pick how and what and when to do.

There's also _access_, maybe you don't go to the gym in June, because you're overwhelmed, but can't go, but you can go back when you're ready.

If we're a gym, how do we make ourselves conducive to different kinds of gym members?

That meant taking into account the lurkers. Missing link: content. Workshops, fireside chats, which is useful for lurkers.

Cater to members' different engagement needs. who you consider a community member. The "disengaged" members are also community members.

#### BCM is moving to a paid

An email: relatively disengaged but really successful woman. Excited she was about paying! Signed up for an annual member.

#### Two big takeaways

Building the community on a social media platform is really risky. It can be ripped from you. They are borrowed, you need to ... move / own the community link.

The community is not a group, it's a gym. Engagement will vary. Let people participate how they want, cater for them.

Social media has destroyed ability to build communities, because The Algo.

Communities are fragmented.

Algorithmic feeds are here to stay, we hate it, but it works. Find communites in different, more private ways. Like-minded people will always find ways to connect.

#### Q&A: do you think that small but high comms are the future?

Yes, probably they'll win out in the end. Newsletter space there's still hope. Bullhorns to millions is largely done.

#### Q&A: federated platforms like mastodon or discord?

Most users don't care about the underlying technology, ultimately it doesn't matter where they are.

### talk 4: Unleashing Open Source: The Power of Community-Led Growth in Go-to-Market Strategy by JZ Zhang

How do I get more eyeballs on my open source project?

And I'm resource constrained...

JZ: [charm.sh](https://charm.sh), went from 10k -> 100k stars.

#### Go to market approaches

1. Enterprise: Top down, big contracts to IBM, etc...
1. partner sales: rev share model
1. PLG (product led growth): self service, add credit card, lower cost, notion, airtables, zoom, etc
1. FOCUS: community-led growth

Open source community is the secret sauce to this. Opinionated, engaged, passionate individuals. Some of them are non-technical users.

There's a finesse to handling them well. Three case studies on some approaches that they've done well.

#### case study 1: charm

graph showing 4: bubbletea, gum, vhs, and glow. gum and vhs goes straight and narrow from 0-10k stars. Lot of luck, but intentional.

Playbooks on how they honed this, how to recreate this for new projects:

##### Gum

Feedback. Charm's libraries were written with Go. Users who are not Go devs: Can you create some CLI tools that are not Go based?

Hence gum. Language agnostic thing.

1. week of launch: prep good docs, readme with examples
1. thursday 9am pst (important): launch to friendly subreddit communities (engaged, honed in, been there for months! not cold) r/cli, r/unixporn, r/golang
1. 10am-12pm :announce on discord, youtube video, linkedin, twitter. Owned and operated spaces.
1. engage engage engage with everyone! answer questions, respond to replies
1. end of the day: hit top 3 across all 3 reddit forums, end of 72 hours: global github trending top 3

##### Trials

Finding your audience = trial and error. 9am pst was honed in, so noon, 8am, 10pm were all tried.

Tried hackernews, after a couple of times they were shadowbanned a few times, so ... hn is off limits.

Partnering with other companies, like GitHub. IRL event in GH HQ, lots of devs turned up. charm gave away mechanical keyboards and rubber duckies.

X developers collab on twitte spaces.

collab with tailscale.

try to find out what makes sense, but not every company will be a fit.

##### Results

After the playbook notes were hit:

* Julia Evans reshared it (ceejbot tweet)
* Gregkh shared it
* Go weekly newsletter, banner
* GitHub youtube video about it

Luck: Tweet about tagging github global trending, went viral, but this was luck. Can try to recreate it.

##### Takeaway

Already made playbook with lots of trials, there's a push / pull. You need to find your own playbook through your trial / error.

#### case study 2: supabase

open source firebase alternative. YC alum.

Launch week: every 3 months, hosted event, ship a new major feature every day.

Then community led meetups since 2 years ago. It's _only_ commnuity led, no supabase person organising it. Around the world! Wait, no active supabase team members at these events?

Supabase world tour: kinda like Swiftie.

Meetup attendance: tokyo couple dozen. Nigeria: couple dozen. And then a few dudes streaming in NZ.

##### Takeaway: IRL is back

generate opportunities for your community to meet in person, even hosted by them

it will in fact make them supa-fans

#### case study 3: vercel

cloud platform, creator of next.js

Secret sauce to community led growth: building high quality demos (!!)

super forkable, really easy to get started. Try it, buy vercel, etc...

examples of demos:

* Emoji todo
* storefront for vercel's merch (you can fork it and get started with your own merch store)
* gemini AI chatbot

How did you think of the idea of the highly polished demos?

Guillermo was in tokyo, he was demoing: "oh yeah, our data servers are in east coast US". Audience was starstruck, deals were closed (servers far, thing still fast).

Community engagement for vercel:

* lots of videos about "thing with vercel" - th3o.gg, beyond fireship, developers digest

3 companies funded from templates: julius for example

##### Takeaway: spend extra time to produce demos, make it with forkability in mind

Users will share, users will want to use it, users will make content about it

#### Recap

community-led growth as go-to-market is good

charm, supabase, vercel (see above)

[JZ](https://twitter.com/jzmusings) left charm, and will be using the strategies going forward.

If you're considering starting a company:

> Life isnt' how to surfvive the storm, it's about how to dance in the rain" - vivian greene

#### Q&A: how do you launch multiple times if you have one product

The trial of error only works if you have multiple products. Gum is 20th, so they had 19 others to experiment with. 

#### Q&A: how forgiving were users in the error of the trial and error?

People are opinionated and passionate. People sometimes shred companies for stuff, but if you're intentional, communicating, and care, they are very forgiving and helpful. Maybe it's a luck.

#### Q&A: do you think IRL events is the play now that the twitter feeds aren't the same?

We are at the merge, IRL. You tell me :D.

Scott: Does charm / whatever next, what the playbook would be: online, twitter vs IRL buying people beers or something?

Online is important, depends on the project, capital efficient, people efficient. But IRL is super important. For a very small company, like charm, an IRL event is super challenging / exhausting.

Host community led meetups all over, send beer money (not people), and that's still good!

Both, but mostly online, because efficiency, but wants to incorporate IRL as much as possible.

### talk X: designing open-source orgs for longevity by daniel thompson-yvetot

#### Start

Crab Nebula. Always starts with an idea, two friends. Spend free time making something, underestimate the work involved, don't care. It's ok to give up, don't be alone, don't optimize anything, don't pay for anything, setup branch protection :D.

#### 2. core team forms

Collaborative problem solving, great way to forge friendships. Find out early who you can't work with. Use light consensus, the doers decide, leverage codeowners, choose a licence, chart a vision.

#### 3. working groups then evolve

No room for other people in the core team. That's where working groups form, they have special knowledge about a thing, they have skills, they have drive. Branch protection come in to play here. Many people pull on the same rope.

* Schedule office hours
* the doers are empowered
* recruit contributors
* introduce accountability
* reduce bus-factor
* watch mental health

Risk: people come, do stuff, get bored, leave. Accountability introduced: their work unlock the possibility for other people's work.

#### 4. an entity

In the shadows: just do whatever you need to do to keep on working. Open collective for donations, github for project management, discord for communication, and it just kind of works...

##### Non-profit

Aligns closely with the spirit of open source, just a paper tiger.

Tenant in a foundation (eg linux foundation), or a pure foundation (cash intensive).

Important things it should do: Own the moral rights to code, and own trademarks.

##### A company

I you need to evolve or want venture capital, being a company helps

#### 5. where's the money?

##### Bootstrap

probably you're here, not paying yourself, big red flag. Not sustainable. Two ways to get out of this: set a timeout or make a plan to get paid. Maybe it's a hobby.

Dishonourable thing to get paid for open source, which is a scam.

##### Donations

Not as much cash as you hope, but will get you stickers. Open collective, or github sponsors, or friends and family. Transparency is super important here. Community needs to be okay with this.

Do make stickers.

##### Sponsorships

Leverage open source programs from companies who care. Digital Ocean / Netlify. Cal.com, or Github open source program.

##### Grants

You can apply for grants. Probably more work than they're worth, if you need to focus for a few months, could be a good idea. NGI, NLNET, Sovereign Tech Fund, Funding Box, [https://sploro.eu/cascade-funding](https://sploro.eu/cascade-funding).

Grants are slow money, more money comes more problems. Who gets paid?

##### OSS Tip / Revshare

Convince people buying your services to optionally pay more for the open source you use. Like Humble Bundle, kinda like carbon offsets, scalar.

##### Bounties

This is money going back to the community, huge admin burden, way to grow the community and potentially recruit. algora.io

##### Angles / VC

Need a company, accounting and legal entity needed. SAFE, Office sponsorship, coaching.

##### Venture

The risk of a rugpull is even becoming a meme. What model can stick? Protect the source.

OSS Capital, lightning ventures, speed invest, [awesome-oss-investors](https://github.com/octolens/awesome-oss-investors) (github page here).

#### 6. Risks

##### Burn out

not taking time for yourself, losing the vision, infighting, too much bureaucracy. Pay attention to your health, watch for warning signs, talk to people regularly.

##### Alienation

Company -> people in the community will say "hey you're stealing from open source". Communicate better.

##### Entitlement

stay calm, be firm. Flip their anger to understanding.

OSS is free, downstream must disclose, have community guidelines, reach out privately.

Downstream must disclose: people aren't disclosing what libraries folks are using if they're not sharing code. It's a legal requirement to disclose an open source library.

##### Regulations

If you haven't heard about the cyber resilience act

DSA, DMA, CRA, PLD, DORA, CE, etc...

Some cases it does impact open source.

#### Q&A: have you gotten pushback for taking money for projects

The risk of taking money is moot point. Everybody has some money, they got it somehow. Honourable way: get money, provide value.

#### Q&A: how do you avoid burnout?

Block lunch break, go for walks, 4 day workweek, woodshop, family, cats, camera. Best I can do for myself, pay close attention to folks, reach out if worried.

#### Q&A: when you deciding how to spend money from community, do you involve them, or just tell them?

Have leftover money after trademark shenanigans, want bounties, so voting platform, using algora.io.

#### Q&A: is there a short way to know if they apply to my oss project? 

No

#### Q&A: how to become a tenant in a foundation

In a linux foundation, or commons conservancy: bring together people, write a charter, how they're going to be voted in, what their responsibilities are, that paper gets adopted by the foundation itself, and that's ... that?

### talk 7: devrel and community panel: Jana Iris, Cassidy Williams, David Edoh Bedi, Jonathan Weiss - moderated by Saron Yitbarek

Cassidy: main queen, funny videos, engaging blog posts, tech content, courses, live stream, etcetc.

Biggest ROI from the content: financially or in general?

General, in engagement: newsletter probably the biggest one. Started doing because huh it would be kinda cool to provide resources, but led to discord. Interested in similar things, return is in people relationships. Newsletter since 2017, 17k subs.

David: devrel is new to you: how important is engineering background?

Helpful, being an effective dev advocate helps to have the engineering empathy, to know how engineering works, but people follow different paths. Former stripe coworker got psychology, then bank, taught how to code, then dev advocate. David started at Microsoft engineering, but passion was talking to users, customers, got to go to toshiba installing windows, kenya, rescue place keeping data in azure, etc. Pure engineering wasn't enough.

If you like coding, and talking to people, you don't need engineering background.

Jana: empathy, helpfulness is useful. Empathy towards the problems. Working to solve people problems and dev problems is the lasting one.

Jana: community and dev relations, now investor, so... must be great for the portfolio companies. Where do companies struggle?

Still impressed that everyone is still here. Lot of community events, but this one was special. Also multiple people mentioned she didn't drink the wine, but now she is.

After hashicorp, she started angel investing, joined a fund, joined a venture, suddenly had to understand businesses, had to take classes, etcetc. 500mm usd fund, early stage (seed) fund.

Founder-product fit, early customer love, how big can the business be?

Saron: How do startups deal with devrel?

Jana: people apply the same playbook, but maybe sometimes you don't need a separate devrel person, sometimes an engineer talking to others can be enough.

Cassidy: some startup advising: you don't need a dev advocate, you need a tech writer.

Saron: John, AI, is useful, but don't want to be replaced, anxiety and excitement, how do you manage it?

John: Lots of excitement, and empathy. AI will not replace, but will be a tool to accelerate dev stuff. Lots of questions about privacy, control in conversation with customers. Important to build products that customers want.

Saron: does AI have empathy?

John: depends on how you build these systems. It's a core tenet. Customer trust is critical. If you build systems with trust and security in mind, that is good.

Jana: software development: how much is actually coding? Sometimes it's writing an RFC, sometimes it's talking to people.

John: what's the problem to solve? Implementing the thing is the least of the problems, but figuring out what to implement is the most important. The human part isn't going to go away. GenAI is going to help with the implementation, but the thinking of what to implement is importanter.

Saron: David, social media is important, but you're not... really active on there. How do you keep tabs on stuff?

David: one of the lurkers, listening, reading. Lot of 1:1 convos with people. At stripe there are a lot of surfaces to talk to users to figure out what's happening. Then there's youtube, launched a new forum to interact with users, hackernews, etc... the usuals.

Lot of social media happens through the stripe channels. Made a new video of a new stripe feature. Passion is talking to people. One of the programs is a developer advisory board: meet once a month, chat with product teams, from the early drafts, get feedback.

Jana: hot take!

Cassidy: most of the good dev rels aren't even on social media. If you have empathy, you don't need social.

David: yeah, if you go to events like this, talking to folks, you'll figure out what people want, and then feed back to product teams.

Jana: having your own personal brand, online presence is important. Jana's own identity was hashicorp. Even having a website, or a tagline is helpful. When you are looking for a job, having a strong personal brand makes it clear what you want.

Saron: John, wanna go back to you. How do you deal with competition? AI tools is such a huge competition area, how do you stand out?

John: there are different niches for the software dev lifecycle. How can we work with you to help with AWS? We're looking into how we can solve problems people have? How do I get started with aws? Which services do I pick?

Customers who are looking at aws already are good, but they want to help develop software.

Going to events is important to figure out what people need, what people are struggling with.

Cassidy: funny story: aws services, there are so many of them: how many of these are actual aws services? actual employees of aws didn't score high.

Saron: Cassidy: if you're developing a dev tool, for marketing, there are so many places you can go to, where do you start?

Cassidy: I need to reach The People, because that doesn't work. Targeted, use your existing networks. Niche it down, find them, target. They might be on a subreddit, mastodon, whatever. Start with specific places first, build trust, and then grow from there.

Jana: everything is crowded, kubecon, all signage was the same, everything was buzzwords. In order to stand out, your messaging needs to be unique, push the boundaries, but companies are kind of afraid to do that.

Cassidy: chat with friend who is an seo person: you do wanna stand out, but you want to ride the hype-wave.

Saron: Jana: what would have stood out?

Jana: OLLAMA: white booth with an ollama paris illustration, and nothign else. No words. That stood out from the black and white text.

Hashicorp: no cutesy mascots, no ball pits. Defensive luxury. GitHub had octocat.

Saron: Cassidy: if you do so much advising, serious, funny, playful... , how do you do decide which one to be?

Cassidy: lean into your strengths. If you're not a funny person, that's okay, don't try to be. Don't psuh into a direction that you're not. If you fake it too much, it's gonna be uncomfrotable, and folks are gonna expect that.

Supabase: you're funny, you should be funny. Lean into the memes! And users love it! If that's your vibe, lean into it!

Jana: hashicorp brand were based on the founders. Organizing hashicorp europe in 2016, they had lights, fog, smoke. Mitchell's understaded. Arman is persian, flashy. Fog, lights on stage worked differently.

David: it's something they're trying to do at stripe, need to be buttoned up, serious. experimenting with new things. let the creativity shine through. Reason for experimentation: viewership stagnated.

Cassidy: if the team gets to a point where they want to try becoming a personality, and the company is big enough, then they can lean into it, because that was the team strength.

John: AWS is a serious company, but recently an internal team built an internal thing, which is pocket ___, decided to launch with a different brand, because it's a different vibe. Lean into the funny, forgo the AWS default. Don't delute the main brand, but explore.

Cassidy: guidelines are good, but experiment.

Saron: David, you work at stripe, well know, what is there to do in devrel?

David: good Q. There's a lot, when you do devrel at a company the size of stripe, a lot of work ends up being external. Meetups, etc. H2 work, prioritization: what's the biggest bang for the buck? They take care of all the example code, they're trying to figure out what to keep, what to deprecate. Just building tight relationships with internal teams. At stripe size, some people don't understand what a devrel team does.

The forum: insiders.stripe.dev. Dev teams: struggling to get cohorts of people to run betas to figure out who to invite to things. So forum to invite folks, so devs can invite them.

New products all the time.

Part of the job security is that you have to keep creating content for the new content.

Saron: whole panel: how much harder it is to be a dev than a couple of years ago, there's RTO, no one's hiring, mass layoffs, etc... how do you talk to devs to try your shiny new things, while being mindful what's going on.

John: how is this going to make their life easier? Not trying to sell, but trying to solve a problem, so empathy: we hear you, we wanna make your life better, use this! This is how it's ognna help you sell a thing for leadership.

Jana: Sad when conferences end, plug: next thursday, beer garden with scott.

Cassidy: if you're trying to get devs to use your tools, figure out how to make it a portfolio item for them. give them a leg up.

David: no sales angel to it. Come to conferences to talk to the people, awareness, sometimes people just left their job. Being there, listening, offering help when they can.
